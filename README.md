# PlandoRandomSettings

This program is a custom version of the [*Ocarina of Time* randomzier](https://ootrandomizer.com/) that can apply random values to each of the randomizer settings.
This program allows us to blindly randomize anything and (nearly) everything in the randomizer, rather than just the natively supported random settings.

## Download

Pre-built downloads coming soon. Until then, the program must be built from source.

## Building from source

1. Install Rust:
    * On Windows, download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/) and follow its instructions.
    * On other platforms, please see [the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for instructions.
2. (Skip this step if you're not on Windows.) If you're on Windows, you'll also need to download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (the Community edition should work). On the “Workloads” screen of the installer, make sure “Desktop development with C++” is selected. (Note that [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is not the same thing as Visual Studio. You need VS, not VS Code.)
3. Install [Python](https://python.org/) version 3.6 or higher.
4. Open a command line:
    * On Windows, right-click the start button, then click “Windows PowerShell” or “Command Prompt”.
    * On other platforms, look for an app named “Terminal” or similar.
5. In the command line, run the following command. Depending on your computer, this may take a while.

    ```
    cargo install --git=https://github.com/fenhl/plando-random-settings --branch=riir
    ```
6. You can now launch the app by running the command `rsl-gui`, or use the command-line version `rsl` (see `rsl --help` for details).

## Usage

When opening the app, you will see the following from top to bottom:

1. The app checks for self-updates when opened. It is recommended that you always update to the latest available version, since older versions may break with newer versions of the randomizer.
2. For the Base ROM, select your copy of *Ocarina of Time*. Please see [the randomizer's readme](https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/OoT-Randomizer#installation) for details.
3. For the Output Directory, select a folder where the files generated by the randomizer should be saved.
4. Next, select your preferred weights (i.e. how likely each value of each setting will be). The program comes with some preset weights:
    * **League:** The Random Settings League's season 2 tournament weights. Uses [version 5.2.117 R-1](https://github.com/Roman971/OoT-Randomizer/tree/b670183e9aff520c20ac2ee65aa55e3740c5f4b4) of the randomizer. See [this file](https://github.com/fenhl/plando-random-settings/blob/riir/assets/weights/rsl.json) for the full list.
    * **Solo:** Like League weights but uses the latest version of the randomizer.
    * **Co-op:** Limits the maximum number of required skull tokens to 50, disables Master Quest, and fixes the damage multiplier to normal.
    * **Multiworld:** This disables settings that can cause seeds to take a long time, such as closed Door of Time, Overworld entrance randomizer, or useless hints. It also disables Skip Child Zelda to avoid [this bug](https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/OoT-Randomizer/issues/1210).
5. For League weights, there are no further options, to avoid accidental misconfigurations. For other presets, you can now optionally remove tricks from logic and/or turn off the possibility of starting with random items.
6. For Multiworld weights, select the number of players (also called the world count) using the slider or text box.
7. Click “Generate Seed”. This can occasionally take a while, since it makes 60 attempts at generating a seed (20 distributions, each tried 3 times). Once done, the output directory will contain the patch file that you can send to the players (or apply the patch for yourself with [the randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/generator) by selecting “Generate From Patch File”), as well as the spoiler log and a copy of the settings distributions (which is also considered a spoiler in the Random Settings League).
